# Diabetes_prediction_PyTorch

Background:

Dataset is a collection of medical and demographic data from patients, with diagnosis of diabetes (0 or 1).

Dataset contains features such as gender, age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, 

HbA1c level, and blood glucose level.

This is a classification problem.

Objective:

1) To identify the factors that causes diabetes based on patients' medical history

2) To build a PyTorch ANN prediction model that can predict if the patient will develop diabetes based on a given set of characteristics.
